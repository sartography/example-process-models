## Welcome to SpiffWorkflow

Thank you for coming by and checking things out!

As you follow through these examples we'd like you to do three things each time:

* **View the diagram** - Every process has a primary file - it will be the first file you see in the list of files under the files tab above.  These diagrams fully control what you experience when you click the "Start" button
* **Start up the process** - Click that "Start" Button and step through the process. 
* **Follow any special directions** - rather than just complete the process, read the directions carefully.  In this way we can show you some additional aspects of the system - or you may need to take some other actions to really see everything that is happening.
